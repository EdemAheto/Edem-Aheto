   <h1>DNA and RNA</h1> 
   <h2>What is DNA</h2>
   <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an organism. 
       DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder — a shape known as a double helix. Each strand has a 
       backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. 
       Attached to each sugar is one of four bases: 
       <ul>
           <li>cytosine</li>
           <li>guanine</li>
           <li>Adenine</li>
           <li>Thymine</li>
       </ul>
       The two strands are connected by chemical bonds between the bases: 
       adenine bonds with thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine. The sequence of the bases along DNA’s backbone encodes biological information, such as the instructions for making 
       a protein or RNA molecule.</p>

    <h2>What is RNA</h2>
    <p>Ribonucleic acid (abbreviated RNA) is a nucleic acid present in all living cells that has structural similarities to DNA. Unlike DNA, however, RNA is most often single-stranded.
         An RNA molecule has a backbone made of alternating phosphate groups and the sugar ribose, rather than the deoxyribose found in DNA. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases:
         <ol>
            <li>cytosine</li>
            <li>guanine</li>
            <li>Adenine</li>
            <li>Uracil</li>
         </ol>
         Different types of RNA exist in cells: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). In addition, 
          some RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression. Certain viruses use RNA as their genomic material.</p>
